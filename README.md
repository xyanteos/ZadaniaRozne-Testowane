## General info
> The application i am testing here was a project for OOP C# lessons. 
> In the app I was supposed to create a hospital object with doctors objects as hospital workers and patients  objects assigned to them.
> There was alot lof logic which could be tested so I took advantage of that fact.
> I used NUnit framework for testing purposes.
> The application contains classes:

* Przychodnia (eng. clinic)
* Pacjent (eng. patient)
* Lekarz (eng. doctor)
* Choroba (eng. disease)
> All of the above cases were tested.
> There are 38 tests overall.
> Especially interesting case was with groupAllPacjenci function within Przychodnia class, from which i will put screenshots of and describe briefly below.

## Description
> The function itself is supposed to group patients based on their condition (number of diseases they have), and put them into proper list of patients with said condition.
> There are 3 lists of patients which are called accordingly to their condition state.
* lekkoChorzy - slightly ill
* niezleChorzy - seriously ill
* tragedia - on the edge of death
> As said before each of those are separate lists.
> Because of that fact a list of lists had to be created in order to check in which one of those the patient will be added within the current test case.
